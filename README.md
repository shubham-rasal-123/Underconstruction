Under Construction Page
This project is a simple "Under Construction" page built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), displaying a friendly message and relevant information for users while a site or feature is being developed. The project uses [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) for templating to render dynamic HTML, allowing for easy customization of messages, images, and links. [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is used for small interactive elements, such as countdowns or animations, enhancing user engagement. [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) enables real-time updates during development, making it quick and efficient to deploy changes. This project is ideal for understanding server-side rendering and creating maintenance or placeholder pages.
